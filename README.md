Q Ability: dash / teleport attack - player can teleport in front of an enemy within a radius and unleash a powerful attack (2 times base damage) (cooldown 6 seconds)

W Ability: stun attack - player can stun enemies in a certain radius for 4 seconds (cool down 10 seconds)

Passive Ability: After a last hit, increase the speed and base damage of the hero by 20% for 2 seconds. Only one layer of buff can exist at the same time.

All the custom settings in the UI menu works (hero HP, hero base damage, minion HP, minion base damage, hero speed, allow ability or not).

Right click on ground to move, right click on minions to choose & attack.

Add indication circles of the ranges of the auto attack and the abilities.

To-Do:

- [ ] I linked the minions per wave and time between waves to variables in the game instance, but there is no UI interface to custom them yet.
- [ ] There is no working score system.
- [ ] UI showing cool down time and a short description when hovering over.
- [ ] mouse click Coordinate export.
